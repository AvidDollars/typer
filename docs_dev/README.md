# Instructions for various task during development


## Squashing unnecessary commits (e.g. CI is failing):

**Problem**:
You have extra commits pushed to the repository because of failing tests in CI:
![pushed commits to be squashed](01_failing_CI.png)

**Solution**:
1. checkout a branch with the commits you wanna squash (e.g. **user/frontend** branch)

2. use **rebase** command in **interactive mode**:
```bash
# squashing last 6 commits
git rebase -i origin/user/frontend~6 user/frontend
```

3. "**pick**" last commit, and "**squash**" the other ones:
![squash action](01_squash.png)

4. **update commit message** after the squashing

5. **push changes** to a repository (in this case **user/frontend** branch):
```bash
# '+' for pushing to only one branch
git push origin +user/frontend
```

6. **check the commits** for a branch (in this case **user/frontend** branch):

## Modifying database schema / running migrations:

**Task**:
You need to change schema of one of the tables (in this case **adding unique contraint**)

**Solution**:
1. **change model** (in this case **add unique name constraint**):
![adding new constraint](02_add_unique_constraint.png)

2. goto to the running container for backend:
```bash
# 769 -> 1st 3 letters of running backend container
docker exec -it 769 bash
```

3. run migration:
```bash
# you must be inside "/backend" folder in order to run alembic commands:
cd /backend

# create new revision and provide description, e.g.:
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "add 'unique name' constraint on 'users' table"

> [!TIP]  
> Always check generated migration file before running it.
# run the migration:
alembic upgrade head
```

4. log into running **pgAdmin** container (**localhost:5050**) and check the changes:
![change in table](02_new_contraint.png)

5. commit changes (file where model was changed + new migration file)

## Undo last applied migration where no changes were propagated to DB:

**Problem**:
Last migration was not successful - no changes propagated to DB.

**Solution**:
1. open the file generated by migration and copy **down_revision** id from here:
![migration file](03_migration_file.png)

2. goto **alembic_version** table in DB, change **version_num** to the id copied from migration file (**down_revision**):
![change version num](03_update_db.png)

3. save changes in DB (press **F6** in **pgAdmin**) and delete last migration file which was automatically generated

## Add new 'not null' fields to an existing model:

**Task**:
You need to create new **not null** fields, but migration cannot be applied due to the following error:
```bash
sqlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError: (sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql.asyncpg.IntegrityError) <class 'asyncpg.exceptions.NotNullViolationError'>: column "gross_wpm" of relation "typing_sessions" contains null values
```

**Solution**:
1. add new fields without **not null** constraint:
![new nullable fields](04_add_new_fields.png)

2. create a new revision and run 1st migration (see **step 3** in **Modifying database schema / running migrations**)

3. set **null** fields to actual values:
```sql
update typing_sessions set gross_wpm=0, net_wpm=0, accuracy=0
``` 

4. update fields and run second migration:
